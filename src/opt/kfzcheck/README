KFZcheck.py 
==========

KFZcheck is a small program written in python and uses the gtk toolkit
It searches for car (in german kfz) license plates shortcuts and the citys according to 
the searchword - german example: S for Stuttgart. A german, austrian, swiss and poland license plate
list is till now included.

KFZcheck searches automaticlly for csv files in /opt/kfzcheck/kfzlist/. The files should be
named with the country code => Example de.csv for germany.

The ~/.kfzcheck.ini saves the last selected country so you can load your favorite first :) It will
be set automaticly when you change the country in the gui.

The german file structur is for example => S,Stuttgart,Baden-Württemberg
S is the car license plate shortcut, Stuttgart the according city to the shortcut and Baden-Württemberg
stands for a province (a state in state).

When emblems should be displayed you have to create a folder in /opt/kfzcheck/wappen/ with the countrycode as name.
In the folder you can save the differend emblems. They have to be png files with the exactly name of the province (it's casesensitive).

When you have created a country pack i am interested to integrate it in the offical release - please mail me :)
